# Example Repository
Ok So learned how to use cmd to commit to gitHub(Sounds like marriage proposal)
I also added this code to my .gitconfig file 
[alias]
    lg = log --topo-order --all --graph --date=local --pretty=format:'%C(green)%h%C(reset) %><(55,trunc)%s%C(red)%d%C(reset) %C(blue)[%an]%C(reset) %C(yellow)%ad%C(reset)%n'
    which made my git log look much better and easier to read. Thanks to the tutorial from Kalob Taulien.
